# Mesh Morpher
Use this repository to turn one mesh into another with the power of [NVIDIA-Kaolin](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/kaolin) and [Pytorch](pytorch.org).



## Method

We calculate the chamfer distance between 2 sampled meshes and backpropagate through it to morph a template mesh into the target. Edge length regularization is used to improve smoothness.

```markdown
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([m1.vertices],lr=0.01)

for i in range(epochs):

    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss=chamfer_distance(m1,m2) + edge_length(m1)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

```
